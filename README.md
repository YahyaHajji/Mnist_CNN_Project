# Mnist CNN Project

## Description
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The CNN architecture is designed to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits, leveraging deep learning techniques.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YahyaHajji/Mnist_CNN_Project.git
   cd Mnist_CNN_Project
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the CNN model and evaluate its performance, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can adjust hyperparameters and model architecture in the `main.py` file as needed.
